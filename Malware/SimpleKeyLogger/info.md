# Simple Keylogger

## Description
A basic keylogger written in C that captures keystrokes from a target system and sends them to a remote server. This sample demonstrates how malware can monitor and exfiltrate user input data.

## Overview
This keylogger uses low-level keyboard hooks to intercept keystrokes before they reach applications. It runs in the background, is capable of surviving system reboots by implementing persistence techniques, and uses basic encryption to obfuscate the captured data.

Category: Keylogger

## Features
- Keyboard hook implementation
- Logs all keystrokes to a file
- Basic XOR encryption of log files
- Persistence through registry keys
- Remote data exfiltration capabilities
- Attempts to evade detection by monitoring for security tools

## Detection
- File: %APPDATA%\svchost.exe (not the legitimate Windows svchost)
- Registry: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\System Service
- Network: Beacons to command server at regular intervals
- Process behavior: Hooks keyboard with SetWindowsHookEx
