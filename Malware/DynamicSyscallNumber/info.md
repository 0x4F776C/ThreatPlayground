# Dynamic Syscall Number

## Description
Obtain all syscall numbers by getting a NTDLL handle into the current process, then parsing it's PE headers and examining the export table. This allows us to obtain syscalls number without having to guess for it.

## Overview
One of the simplest way to bypass EDR is to invoke syscall directly. However, syscall number changes alongside OS updates/upgrades. Therefore, it is useful to get hold the syscall number that we want on-the-go.

## Features
- Get NTDLL handle
- Export analysis
- Zw functions filtering
- Sort by RVA
- Syscall number sorting
